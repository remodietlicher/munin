# This is some dummy header

This is an example of how I would use **markdown** to _take notes_ about Rust:

```rust
fn do_something() {
  println!("doing stuff")
}
```

Here are a few points that I like about markdown:

- quick to write
  - quick sublist
- amazing support by the Rust community

To finish this project, there is alot to do:

- [x] drink coffee
- [ ] learn more about Rust
